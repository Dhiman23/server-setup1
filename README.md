# Server Provisioning and Configuration Setup using Terraform and Ansible

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for server provisioning and configuration management. We utilize **Terraform** for provisioning the infrastructure and **Ansible** for configuring the servers.

## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. This project aims to automate the process of server provisioning and configuration using Terraform and Ansible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Terraform**: Installed and configured. [Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- **Ansible**: Installed and configured. [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions. [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

- **ansible/**: Contains Ansible playbooks and roles for server configuration.
- **terraform/**: Contains Terraform configuration files for infrastructure provisioning.

## Setup Instructions

### Terraform

1. **Navigate to the Terraform directory:**

   ```sh
   cd terraform
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Apply the Terraform configuration:**

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

   This command will provision the infrastructure as defined in the Terraform configuration files.

### Ansible

1. **Navigate to the Ansible directory:**

   ```sh
   cd ansible
   ```

2. **Run the Ansible playbook:**

   ```sh
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory
   ```

   This command will configure the servers as defined in the Ansible playbook.

## Usage

After setting up the infrastructure and configuring the servers, you can access your servers and deploy your applications as needed.
